# Monster Battling System

This is a java based recreation of the Pokémon battle system.

## Description

The monster battling system is based on the popular game Pokémon and it's battle system. The goal of the program is to create a way to simulate Pokémon style battles and go beyond with custom moves and Monsters. This program is used as the basis for my other project the [Monster Battling API.](https://github.com/WritingHusky/MainBattleBuilder)

Currently this system is in a useable state with the provided terminal interaction. However as I continue work on the Battling API and consequent Front End, this system will be updated with more features.

## Getting Started

To run the program:
* Clone the repository
